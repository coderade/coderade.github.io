      <description>I personally love the JetBrains tools.&#xA;When I started coding with Eclipse, NetBeans, ADT (for Android development on Eclipse), text editors, and other tools, I thought to myself:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The development with these tools is pretty cool, but the tools are very far from being awesome. Can they be better?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After struggling with these tools for a while, I had the opportunity to try IntelliJ IDEA for Java development.&#xA;I must be honest: at first, I found the IDEA IDE a little complicated because it seemed years ahead of everything I had worked with before.</description>
