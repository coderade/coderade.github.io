      <description>Since I started to use Go on a project at my current job, I decided to create some real projects using the language to understand the language more.
After studying some patterns and understanding how the language works, I decided to create a Games Shelf Application with REST communication, and then, I added GraphQL to the game.
I decided to use PostgreSQL as my database and React.js in the front-end, because, even as I have not used it for a long time, both are my preferred technologies when I think about a database and a front-end framework.</description>
