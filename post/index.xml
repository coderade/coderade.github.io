      <description>On this post I will try to show the new features, improvements and other important changes to Ruby on Rails version 5.
I will try to show how to use the most important features of Rails 5, including Action Cable, Action Controller Renderer, Turbolinks, the Active records, Attributes API and how to use Rails exclusively as a JSON API.
Besides that I will discuss the many other smaller changes in improvements such as the Rails command Router, new Date and Time methods, Secure Tokens and changes to parameters.</description>

      <description>Hi there.
After a few attempts with the coderade .in and .io blogs, I started to write in a blog again and now with no expensive domain and freedom in customization excuses, heheh.
On this blog I will write about code, life hacks and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to share my experiences in this vast life (yeah, with 23 years old).
The blog is powered by Hugo and I normally use the IDEA to write my posts with Markdown ❤️.</description>
