      <description>Since I started coding in 2012, I learned to love the open-source life and how the community is open to sharing and helping others. People share the code they worked hard on, making it possible for anyone in the world to run it in a couple of minutes. They also share their knowledge with questions and answers on StackOverflow and all of the StackExchange sites, creating docs and tutorials on blogs and sites like Medium and GitHub.</description>
